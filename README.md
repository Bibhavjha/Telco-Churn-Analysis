# Telco-Churn-Analysis
This is This project is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.  This has used Telecom data from kaggle to do churn analysis

###### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📊 Executive Summary
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset using Python. The primary objective of this notebook is to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

The notebook follows a structured approach typical of modern EDA workflows, leveraging key Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy. It is suitable for data scientists, analysts, or anyone interested in performing an initial understanding of their dataset.

Key Highlights:
✅ Data loading and inspection

🧼 Data cleaning (missing values, data types)

📈 Univariate and bivariate analysis

🔍 Correlation analysis

📊 Visualization with plots and charts

📂 File Structure
File: Exploratory Data analysis.ipynb
